## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Unlike the last time I took a challenge on FEM, this time I used mobile-first workflow. And I'll admit, despite my previous reservations, I'm starting to see the appeal of it. It will take some getting used to, but I'll learn.

I'll admit, though, that this site is kinda a mess. I'm still a beginner, and CSS grid was kind of a pain for me to set up, especially in combination with media queries. I had to experiment a little, take a trial and error appreach, and as a result the code is a mess, and I'm sure it could be done much more gracefully. Still, it's similar enough to the design.

### Continued development

I definitely need to learn more about CSS grid, this challenge showed me that. The next step after that will be learning to create toggable menus.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This helped me a lot, you can look basically every single CSS property there is.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - Amazing for pretty much the same reason as CSS Tricks. But where on CSS tricks I could find the individual properties, this site I found more useful for things like proper syntax.
